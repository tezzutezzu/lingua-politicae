#Data visualization
The visualization is a force-directed graph. The nodes represent politician Twitter activity and the edges indicate the lexical proximity between them.

#Run the visualization
As the data is stored in a json file, you will need to run a webserver to run the application and not run into cross-origin requests problems.
